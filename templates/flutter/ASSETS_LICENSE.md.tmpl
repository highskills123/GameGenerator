# Asset Licensing – $title

The assets in `assets/imported/` were supplied from a local folder at
project generation time.  **Aibase does not redistribute these assets.**

## Your Responsibilities
- Ensure you hold the appropriate licence for every asset file included here.
- If assets originate from a third-party source (e.g. an itch.io asset pack),
  consult the relevant licence file (often `LICENSE.txt` or `README` inside
  the original pack) before distributing your game.
- Aibase does **not** automatically download assets from any online storefront;
  all assets in this project were explicitly provided by you.

## Placeholder Assets
If Aibase could not find a matching asset in your supplied folder it may have
generated a coloured-rectangle placeholder in code.  Replace these with your
real artwork before publishing.
