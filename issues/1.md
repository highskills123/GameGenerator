# Phase 1: Add Core Flutter and React Native Language Support

## 🎯 Objective
Add Flutter/Dart and React Native as supported target languages in the core Aibase translator.

## 📋 Tasks

### Core Language Support
- [ ] Update `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` dictionary in `aibase.py`
  - Add `'flutter'` → `'Flutter/Dart'`
  - Add `'dart'` → `'Dart'`
  - Add `'react-native'` → `'React Native'`
  - Add `'flutter-widget'` → `'Flutter Widget'`
  - Add `'react-native-component'` → `'React Native Component'`

### Testing
- [ ] Test basic code generation for Flutter
- [ ] Test basic code generation for React Native
- [ ] Verify existing functionality is not broken
- [ ] Update unit tests

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with new supported languages
- [ ] Add usage examples for Flutter
- [ ] Add usage examples for React Native

## 📝 Implementation Details

```python
# In aibase.py, update SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES:
SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES = {
    # ... existing languages ...
    'flutter': 'Flutter/Dart',
    'dart': 'Dart',
    'react-native': 'React Native',
    'flutter-widget': 'Flutter Widget',
    'react-native-component': 'React Native Component'
}
```

## ✅ Success Criteria
- Users can generate Flutter code using `-l flutter` flag
- Users can generate React Native code using `-l react-native` flag
- Generated code is syntactically correct
- All existing tests pass
